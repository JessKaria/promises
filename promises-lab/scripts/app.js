//POKEMONS

/* Using the pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/), display a pokemon's image on a page 
(note, there are lots of different images available here, and you can pick whichever you like). This should work for 
any pokemon, so in other words if you make a request for pikachu, your code should still work if you edit the string 
in your URL, to make a request for squirtle.*/


/* Using the Punk API beers endpoint https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers, display the name and description of each beer on your page.
Extend your beers list from question 2 to include cards with images, descriptions of food pairings, and any other information 
you'd like for each beer. Bonus: Add a way of filtering the beers your show, by their name, as you type. */
